Here are the projects I've done while studying at the Yandex.Practicum courses.

The numbers of the projects indicate the order I did them according to.

The first projects could be a bit simpler in the instruments used (while I was a beginner), but I'm sure, you'll find all of them quite interesting:)

Happy reading!

### <a href='https://github.com/AndreyRysin/yandex_practicum/tree/main/01_Games'>01_Games</a>
* fine data preprocessing and EDA
* statistical analysis

The online store sells computer games all over the world. The historical data about sells, users' and experts' scores, genres and platforms available from open sources. It's necessary to reveal the crucial factors of success of the game.

### <a href='https://github.com/AndreyRysin/yandex_practicum/tree/main/02_Bank_churning'>02_Bank_churning</a>
* feature engineering
* machine learning

Clients have got started to churn from the bank. It's necessary to predict if the client going to churn soon or not.

### <a href='https://github.com/AndreyRysin/yandex_practicum/tree/main/03_Oil_extraction'>03_Oil_extraction</a>
* bootstrap
* risk-benefit & break-even analysis

There is the data on three regions got with satellite. In each region, there are 100 000 fields, where the quality and the volume of the oil reserves were measured. It's necessary to develop an ML-model which will determine the region where the extraction is the most profitable.

### <a href='https://github.com/AndreyRysin/yandex_practicum/tree/main/04_Gold_recovery'>04_Gold_recovery</a>
* fine data preprocessing and EDA
* machine learning

It's necessary to develop a model which predicts the coefficient of the gold recovering from the auriferous ore. There is the data on the extraction and clearing parameters.

### <a href='https://github.com/AndreyRysin/yandex_practicum/tree/main/05_Car_price_scoring'>05_Car_price_scoring</a>
* fine data preprocessing and EDA
* machine learning

A used cars store develops the app which lets to learn market value of the car quickly. It's necessary to develop the model for computing the value.

### <a href='https://github.com/AndreyRysin/yandex_practicum/tree/main/06_Time_series_analysis'>06_Time_series_analysis</a>
* time series analysis
* machine learning

A taxi operator would like to attract extra drivers at peak-level load periods in airports. It's necessary to predict the amount of taxi orders for the next hour.

### <a href='https://github.com/AndreyRysin/yandex_practicum/tree/main/07_Text_processing'>07_Text_processing</a>
* deep learning (text processing)
* TF-IDF
* BERT

The online store is launching a new service: now users able to edit and add the product descriptions on their own. It's necessary to develop a tool which will search for toxic comments and send them for moderation.

### <a href='https://github.com/AndreyRysin/yandex_practicum/tree/main/08_Airlines'>08_Airlines</a>
* statistical analysis

The airline company is learning customers' buying tickets for different routes preferences. It's necessary to analyse the demand for the flights to cities where the largest cultural festivals are going.

### <a href='https://github.com/AndreyRysin/yandex_practicum/tree/main/09_Computer_vision'>09_Computer_vision</a>
* deep learning (computer vision)
* ResNet50

The chain store is introducing a computer vision system for customers' photos processing. Photographing at the cash zone will assist to determine customers' age.

### <a href='https://github.com/AndreyRysin/yandex_practicum/tree/main/10_Telecom_churning'>10_Telecom_churning</a>
* machine learning
* custom ensembles of models
* neural networks

A telecom operator would like to predict customers' churning. If it is revealed, a customer is going to churn, he will be offered with promo codes and special conditions.
